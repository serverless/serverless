**Note: Serverless Framework V.1 is currently under construction and not yet ready**

Serverless is the application framework for building web, mobile and IoT applications on serverless, event-driven compute services, like [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), [Google CloudFunctions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/), [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/) and more. 

The Framework is a command line interface that provides scaffolding, automation and best practices for developing and deploying your serverless architecture. It's also completely extensible via plugins.

This is maintained by a full-time, venture-backed team. For updates, join our [mailing list](http://github.us11.list-manage1.com/subscribe?u=b4fad36768cab222f88338995&id=5f8407dded).  For help, join our [Gitter Chatroom](https://gitter.im/serverless/serverless).  Everyone is welcome!
