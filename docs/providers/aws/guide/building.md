# AWS Lambda Build Configuration

## ESBuild

In Serverless Framework V.4, [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) is included within the Framework for bundling Javascript and Typescript AWS Lambda functions.

By default, if your AWS Lambda handler is using Typescript files directly, the Framework will build your code automatically upon deploy, without a plugin. No configuration is necessary by default.

### Configuration

V.4 introduces a new `build` configuration block, which you can use to customize [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) settings.

```yaml
build:
  esbuild:
    # Enable or Disable bundling the function code and dependencies into a single file. (Default: true)
    bundle: true

    # NPM packages to not be bundled, and instead be available in node_modules, and the zip file uploaded to Lambda.
    #
    # This property only makes sense if bundling is enabled.
    #
    # If no excludes (see below) are specified, and the runtime is set to nodejs16.x or lower,
    # we automatically add "aws-sdk" to the list of externals.
    #
    # If no excludes (see below) are specified, and the runtime is set to nodejs18.x or higher,
    # we automatically add "aws-sdk/*" to the list of externals.
    #
    # Glob patterns are supported here.
    external:
      - '@aws-sdk/client-s3'

    # The packages config, this can be set to override the behavior of external
    # If this is set then all dependencies will be treated as external and not bundled.
    packages: external

    # NPM packages to not be included in node_modules, and the zip file uploaded to Lambda.
    #
    # This option only makes most sense if bundling is disabled. But if bundling is enabled and externals are specified
    # this property can be useful to further control which external packages to be included/excluded from the zip file.
    #
    # Everything specified here is also added to the list of externals (see above).
    #
    # Glob patterns are supported here.
    exclude:
      - '@aws-sdk/*'
      - '!@aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime'

    # By default Framework will attempt to build and package all functions concurrently.
    # This property can bet set to a different number if you wish to limit the
    # concurrency of those operations.
    buildConcurrency: 3

    # Enable or Disable minifying the built code. (Default: false)
    minify: false

    # Enable or configure sourcemaps, can be set to true or to an object with further configuration.
    sourcemap:
      # The sourcemap type to use, options are (inline, linked, or external)
      type: linked

      # Whether to set the NODE_OPTIONS on functions to enable sourcemaps on Lambda
      setNodeOptions: true
```

You may also configure esbuild with a JavaScript file, which is useful if you want to use esbuild plugins. Here's an example:

```yml
build:
  esbuild:
    # Path to the esbuild config file relative to the `serverless.yml` file
    configFile: ./esbuild.config.js
```

The JavaScript file must export a function that returns an esbuild configuration object. For your convenience, the **serverless** instance is passed to that function.

Here's an example of the `esbuild.config.js` file that uses the `esbuild-plugin-env` plugin:

**ESM:**

```js
/**
 * don't forget to set the `"type": "module"` property in `package.json`
 * and install the `esbuild-plugin-env` package
 */
import env from 'esbuild-plugin-env'

export default (serverless) => {
  return {
    external: ['@aws-sdk/client-s3'],
    plugins: [env()],
  }
}
```

**CommonJS:**

```js
const env = require('esbuild-plugin-env')

module.exports = (serverless) => {
  return {
    external: ['@aws-sdk/client-s3'],
    plugins: [env()],
  }
}
```

## Plugin Conflicts

Please note, plugins that build your code will not work unless you opt out of the default build experience. Some of the plugins affected are:

- `serverless-esbuild`
- `serverless-webpack`
- `serverless-plugin-typescript`

The new `build` configuration is customizable by plugins. We will be introducing more features around this soon.
