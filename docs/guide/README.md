# Guide

This guide will help you building your Serverless services.
We'll start by giving you information on how to install Serverless. After that we create and deploy a service, invoke a
services function and add additional event sources to our function.

At the end we'll add custom provider resources to our service and remove it.

This guide is Amazon web service specific but can be applied to any other provider as the steps are similar.
