# Reference AWS S3 Objects

You can reference S3 values as the source of your variables to use in your service with the `s3:bucketName/key` syntax. For example:

```yml
service: new-service
provider: aws
functions:
  hello:
    name: ${s3:myBucket/myKey}-hello
    handler: handler.hello
```

In the above example, the value for `myKey` in the `myBucket` S3 bucket will be looked up and used to populate the variable.
Buckets from all regions can be used without any additional specification due to AWS S3 global strategy.
