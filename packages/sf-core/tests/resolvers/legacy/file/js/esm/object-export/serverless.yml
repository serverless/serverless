    #   foo.js default export is not a function so it's looking for a named export
    #   when variable resolves to a string, it can be used standalone or as a part of another string
    name: ${file(foo.js):prefix}-hello-${file(foo.js):suffix}

    #   no key is provided so it takes the default export, which is an object
    #   export can resolve to an object, but then variable cannot be part of string property
